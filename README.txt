Get notifications when your Husqvarna Automower has parked or start a rescue-mission flow when it is stuck somewhere. Or have Homey paus the Automower when motion is detected in the garden.

You could prevent your sprinklers from running when the Automower is working.

Combined with Homey controlling automatic irrigation this is one step closer to a smart garden.
